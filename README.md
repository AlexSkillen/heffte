About
=====

HEFFTE library is being developed as part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), which is a joint
project of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and National Nuclear Security
Administration (NNSA). HEFFT will deliver highly efficient FFT computation on heterogeneous systems, targeting the upcoming exascale machines.

Acknowledgments
===============

This research was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC),
a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations
(Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration)
responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem,
including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering
and early testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.

This research uses resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility,
which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported under Contract DE-AC05-00OR22725.
